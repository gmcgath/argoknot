Argoknot can (among other things to come) convert CSV files to JSON. The input
is a CSV file which can contain the following fields:
	title 
	composers 
	lyricists 
	performers
	album 
	tune 
	keywords
	year 

In its current form, it's restricted to one value per field. The command line specifies the order of the fields.

Command line arguments:

--input		Path to the input file
--output	Path to the output file to create. Will overwrite an existing file,.
--fields	Followed by field names indicating the order of the comma-separated fields

python Argoknot/song_csv_to_json.py --input foo.csv --output bar.js --fields title composer year
