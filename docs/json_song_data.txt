The Argoknot project centers on a way of representing song data as JSON.
The initial focus is on filk songs, the folk music of science fiction and
fandom, but it's applicable to songs of any kind.

A song file consists of any number of JSON song objects. A song object
can have any or all of the following keys. A "title" value is mandatory;
all others are optional.

	title
	composers
	lyricists
	performers
	album
	tune
	keywords
	year

Any key may be associated with a string value. The following keys may take 
an array of strings:

	composers
	lyricsts
	performers
	keywords

Question: Should other keywords also allow arrays? The "title" value should
be just one string, since it functions as an identifier for the song,
and it's not clear if "tune" and "year" make sense with multiple values,
but it would be more general to allow multiple values for everything
except the title. In this case, the keys should be changed to their
plural form.

The lack of globally unique identifiers is intentional; they require an
authority, which complicates the coordination of independent projects.
Different songs may collide by having the same title.

What other fields should be allowed? 

The implementation should be extensible. Implementers should be able to
add their own fields. Other implementations can ignore them but shouldn't
break because of unknown fields.
